# Tuples
There are imutable (no changable) data structures in python. We use **Pranthesis ( )** in tuples.

#### Syntax:

```
tuple = (item1, item2, item3...)
```

#### Example

```
grades = ("a", "b", "c", "d")
```

## Accessing Data
This is how we grab data from a tuple.

#### Example 1:
Grabs 1st item of tuple.

```
print(grades[0])
```

#### Example 2:
Grabs alls items of tuple.

```
print(grades)
```

## Methods
We can't use methods to `.append()` and `.pop()` to add and remove data in tuples.
