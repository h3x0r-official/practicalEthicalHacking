# Looping
Loops are handy to run a task repeativily until conditions are met.

## For Loop
A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

### Example

```
cards = ["BD card", "Party card", "Aniversary Card"]
for x in cards:
	print(x)
```

### Output:
```
BD card
Party card
Aniversary Card
```

## While Loop
With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

### Example

```
i = 0

while i < 10:
	print(i)
	i += 1
```

### Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```
