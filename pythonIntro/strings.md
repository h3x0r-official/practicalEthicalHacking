# Strings

String is any some text used to print as it was coded. These are usually srrounded in qoutes.
There are **four** main ways to use to strings as follows.

```
"Hello, Wordl!"
```

To create python scripts in linux we can declare **Header** for ease. To start a python script in linux operating systems.

```
#!/bin/python3
```


## Double Qoute
 In python we can qoute strings in double qoutes for example I want to print out `Hello World` I will write them in double qoutes `"Hello World"` using `print()` function in python.

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Single Qoute
In python we also can initiate strings with single qoutes.
For example:

```
print('Hello, World!')
```

## Multi-Lines
We can also create multi line string using **triple qoute**.
For example:

Code:
```
print("""This is multi
line string.""")
```

Output:
```
This is multi
line string.
```

## Concatenate
In python we even can concatenate(add) strings.
For example:

Code:
```
print("Python is " + "awesome.")
```

Output:
```
Python is awesome.
```
